			<section class="about"><p>I'm Victor Moraes, currently majoring in Computer Engineering at CEFET-MG and working as a Full Stack Developer at CI&T. 
				I'm passionate about technology and everything that surrounds it, with a little bias towards Machine Learning and Data Science, which 
				I can say that I am in love with these subjects, but I'm studying hard and I'm still a work in progress in the AI world, but I truly 
				believe that AI is going to entirely change the world as we know it and I am working hard to be part and contribute to said revolution.</p>

				<p>I worked in government companies, mid-sized companies and even startups. Also, I have personal projects, these projects being all about Machine 
				Learning. I am eager to learn and every opportunity that is handed to me is an opportunity to learn and grow in both professional and personal fields. 
				I am a firm believer that a day without learning and growing is a wasted day.</p>
