    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      As a seasoned software engineer with a decade of experience, I specialize in Backend Engineering, but I can also work in Data Engineering and DevOps roles. 
      I am adept at creating scalable, efficient, and seamless solutions to complex problems in various tech environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my career, I have worked as a contractor in giant companies like Major League Baseball, Kohl's and Coca-Cola, 
      where I successfully built and maintained business-critical applications, developed efficient data pipelines, and 
      streamlined deployment processes. I take pride in my ability to learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, and work collaboratively with teams to achieve project goals.

      Proficient in multiple programming languages, including Python, Node, Java, and JavaScript. I also have hands-on experience 
      working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Elasticsearch databases. Additionally, I am familiar with tools like Terraform and Shell, 
      which enable me to craft reliable and maintainable infrastructures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in clean code, agile methodologies, and in the value of robust, well-documented, and user-friendly applications.
